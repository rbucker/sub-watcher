This project currently depends on TornadoWeb, redislogging, redis-py and redis.

* TornadoWeb because I like the way it handles the command line options
* redis logging because it's simple enough; although I'd prefer to 
  incorporate some native code instead of yet another library which
  goes against the grain.
* redis-py these libs are needed by the reporting portion of the watcher.
* redis goes without saying that this code needs to connect to an available
  redis server out there.

You must have a redis server available and running. I tested with 
version 2.2.11. (2.4 is around the corner and I need to test the 
libs before I can stamp it approved.)

I will be adding ZeroMQ as an optional library shortly. This will
load the zmq libs is they are available. The comandline options
will only be available if the zmq libs are loaded or something 
like that.
