This project currently depends on TornadoWeb, redislogging and redis.

You must have a redis server available and tunning. I tested with 
version 2.2.11. (2.4 is around the corner and I need to test the 
libs before I can stamp it approved.)

I will be adding ZeroMQ as an optional library shortly. This will
load the zmq libs is they are available. The comandline options
will only be available if the zmq libs are loaded or something 
like that.
