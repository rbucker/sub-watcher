The installation process is pretty simple. I'll script it here so that the
lazy people can just run it a command at a time. With the exception that
I'm not going to tell you how to install python for your distribution. Also, 
this assumes that you are using a linux distro... in my case Ubuntu 10.04 (TLS).

PS: I thought about putting the dependencies in the source tree but I realized
I did not want the responsibility. I suppose I could create a separate project
called sub-watcher-deps but that also sucks. Besides I have other projects
that depend on this project and I don't like the idea that there may be multiple
versions of deps hanging around.

Food for thought anyway.

--[BEGIN]--
cd /tmp
wget https://github.com/downloads/facebook/tornado/tornado-2.0.tar.gz
tar zxvf tornado-2.0.tar.gz
cd tornado-2.0
python setup.py install

cd /tmp
wget http://redis.googlecode.com/files/redis-2.2.12.tar.gz
tar zxvf redis-2.2.12.tar.gz
cd redis-2.2.12
make
make install

cd /tmp
git clone https://github.com/andymccurdy/redis-py.git
cd redis-py
python ./setup.py install

cd /tmp
git clone https://github.com/jedp/python-redis-log
cd python-redis-log
python ./setup.py install

Once you have completed the task above, move these python executables 
anywhere you want.
