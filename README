GENERAL

I have not documented the purpose of this application yet.  It will
be public and open source. I hope to finalize my ideas shortly and
start posting them here. This is something I have wanted to do for 
a while and I think a lot of sysadmins and stakeholders will agree.


LICENSING

That sucks. Since these are essentially snippets of code they
should not be encumberred by licensing of any kind. Of course
feel free to make reasonable attribution to the author. For
example:

NOTES: this is the version of the redis-logger that I'm using. It's nice and
simple. The part I like best is the way it handles exceptions and traceback.
The use of a JSON wrapper makes parsing the data easier.

NOTES: this is a nice alternative approach:
