GENERAL

I have not documented the purpose of this application yet.  It will
be public and open source. I hope to finalize my ideas shortly and
start posting them here. This is something I have wanted to do for 
a while and I think a lot of sysadmins and stakeholders will agree.


LICENSING

That sucks. Since these are essentially snippets of code they
should not be encumberred by licensing of any kind. Of course
feel free to make reasonable attribution to the author. For
example:
